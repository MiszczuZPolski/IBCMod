# About

Adds a breaching charge capable of destroying blocked doors and demolishing walls with minimal collateral damage.

This is an alternate and smaller implementation of [Breaching Charge](https://github.com/ampersand38/Breaching-Charge) by Ampersand. Source available [ampersand38/Breaching-Charge](https://github.com/ampersand38/Breaching-Charge) under MIT License, however this implementation is mostly inspired by it and most of the code has been rewritten in unscheduled environment instead.

For IBC Mod, source code was taken from [Synixe Contractors Mod](https://github.com/SynixeContractors/Mod/tree/main/addons/breaching), which is licensed under GPL-3.0.
